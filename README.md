## Introduction
A significant participant in the luxury and business hotel industries in India, AtliQ Grands is struggling to maintain revenue and market share as a result of heightened competition and internal inefficiencies. The managing director has started a deliberate move towards the integration of business and data intelligence in order to solve this. In order to use historical data for insights and decision-making, the revenue management team has partnered with a third-party data analytics service provider. The mission assigned to a data analyst is to create a dashboard that offers practical information with the goal of helping AtliQ Grands maximise revenue and recover market share in the cutthroat hotel industry.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
